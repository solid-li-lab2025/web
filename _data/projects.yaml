  description: We utilize scattering to understand the statistical atomic arrangement of materials. We apply the diffraction methods to understand long-range crystal structure and pair distribution function(PDF) to understand the local short-range structure of the materials. We are employing in-situ and operando measurements to track the structural evolution behaviors of the materials under different conditions. Our group travels to various national laboratories to utilize the Synchrotron X-ray and  Neutron source.
