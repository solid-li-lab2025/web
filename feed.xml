Clark Magnet Elementary School in Monroe, where we introduced students to the chemistry behind batteries and guided them through a hands-on fruit battery activity. The kids were enthusiastic and deeply engaged!</p>

<p>Glad to to encouter many students with curiosity and hope our hands-on activity will motivate them to become the next-generation scientists.</p>
